# North Carolina Brew-venturing
#------------------------------

# If you are or are becoming craft beer fan like us, this is for you. We have combined a few data sources from APIs to help you plan out your ideal brewery-filled trip in North Carolina.

# Here is what we have pulled together:
#   1. Brewery data - we used the BreweryDB's API and filtered down brewery data for the following brewery types: brewpub, micro, regional, and large
#   2. Hotel data - in case your day trip turns into an overnighter and you need a place to stay, we pulled in hotel data using Google Places API for you to use. 
#   3. Weather data - worried about the weather spoiling your trip? We pulled in historical data from the OpenWeatherMap API to help you get a rough idea if you will be dealing with rain or shine. 

# We have created a relational database connecting these disparate sources on latitude and longitude. The benefit of this connection is it will allow users to create custom analyses specific to wherever brewery/brewies they plan to visit in North Carolina.
