# North Carolina Brew-venturing
------------------------------

## If you are or are becoming craft beer fan like us, this is for you. We have combined a few data sources from APIs to help you plan out your ideal brewery-filled trip in North Carolina.

## Here is what we have pulled together:
###  1. Brewery data - we used the Open Brewery DB API and filtered down brewery data for the following brewery types: brewpub, micro, regional, and large
###  2. Hotel data - in case your day trip turns into an overnighter and you need a place to stay, we pulled in hotel data using Google Places API for you to use. 
###  3. Ratings data - curious to know what others think? We pulled in brewery rating data and the number of user ratings using Google Places API to help you see what other consumers have thought.

### We have created a relational database connecting these disparate sources on brewery ID. The benefit of this connection is it will allow users to create custom analyses specific to wherever brewery/brewies they plan to visit in North Carolina.
